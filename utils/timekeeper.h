/**
 * timekeeper.h - Centralized timing authority for sample-accurate MIDI sync
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Single source of timing truth that bridges MIDI clock (24 PPQN) and audio
 * samples (44.1kHz). Essential for quantization, loop recording, and any
 * feature that needs to know "what time is it?" in the audio world.
 *
 * DESIGN:
 * - Audio timeline: Monotonic sample counter (incremented by audio ISR)
 * - MIDI timeline: Beat/bar position (synced from MIDI clock ticks)
 * - Lock-free: Atomic operations for cross-thread safety
 * - Sample-accurate: All timing in samples, not microseconds
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   // In audio ISR (every 128-sample block):
 *   TimeKeeper::incrementSamples(AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES);
 *
 *   // In app thread (when MIDI clock ticks):
 *   TimeKeeper::syncToMIDIClock(avgTickPeriodUs);
 *
 *   // In any thread (query timing):
 *   uint64_t now = TimeKeeper::getSamplePosition();
 *   uint32_t toNextBeat = TimeKeeper::samplesToNextBeat();
 *   uint64_t beatSample = TimeKeeper::beatToSample(4);  // Sample position of beat 4
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - Sample position: Absolute sample count since audio start (monotonic)
 * - Beat position: Musical beat number (0, 1, 2, 3...), synced to MIDI clock
 * - Samples per beat: Calibrated from MIDI clock period (handles tempo changes)
 * - Bar: 4 beats (assumes 4/4 time signature)
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * - Audio ISR: incrementSamples() only
 * - App thread: syncToMIDIClock(), transport controls, queries
 * - All methods use atomic operations (lock-free, wait-free)
